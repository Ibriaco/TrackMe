	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Purpose}
		 This document represents the \texttt{Requirement Analysis and Specification Document} (RASD) for TrackMe software. Main goals of this project are to specify a system that will be able to store and analyze users' health data, to grant third parties to access these data and to offer elderly people a rapid assistance based on their health parameters, if needed.
		 At the same time, goals of this document are to describe the system through functional and nonfunctional requirements, to analyze customers' needs, to show the limits of the software, indicating the typical use cases that can occur.
		\subsubsection{Goals}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G1}{\textbf]}: Allow visitors to easily register in the system.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item {[G1.1]}: Allow individuals to register providing credentials and personal informations.
					\item {[G1.2]}: Allow third parties to register providing credentials and legal informations.
				\end{itemize}
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G2}{\textbf]}: Allow users to simply share personal information/health parameters.
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G3}{\textbf]}: Allow third parties to access data shared by users.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item {[G3.1]}: Allow third parties to access data of specific individuals (through an identifier).
					\item {[G3.2]}: Allow third parties to access anonymized data of groups of individuals.
					\item {[G3.3]}: Allow third parties to subscribe to new data of a specific individual and to receive them.
				\end{itemize}
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G4}{\textbf]}: Allow third parties to monitor specific users' parameters.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item {[G4.1]}: Allow third parties to retrieve personal users information.
					\item {[G4.2]}: Allow third parties to monitor health status parameters.
					\item {[G4.3]}: Allow third parties to monitor activity parameters.
				\end{itemize}
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G5}{\textbf]}: Guarantee the elderly users to receive an immediate assistance by an ambulance in case of high risk disease.
			\item {\textbf[}\textbf{G6}{\textbf]}: Guarantee the preservation of the privacy of the users.
		\end{itemize}
	
		\subsection{Scope}
		\texttt{TrackMe} is a company that wants to develop a software-based service allowing third parties to monitor the location and health status of individuals.
		Hence, the system has to be composed by two specific services:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Data4Help}\\\\This service supports the registration of individuals who agree that TrackMe acquires their data (through electronic devices such as smartwatches). \\In addition, it supports the registration of third parties that can request:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Access to the data of some specific individuals, who can accept/refuse it.
					\item Access to anonymized data of groups of individuals. These requests are approved by TrackMe if it is able to properly anonymize the requested data. The request is rejected if it is way too specific.
				\end{itemize}
		As soon as a request for some certain data is approved, TrackMe makes the previously saved data available to the third party. Also, it allows the third party to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as they are produced.
			\item \textbf{AutomatedSOS}\\\\This service is oriented to elderly people: monitoring their health status parameters, the system can send to the location of the customer an ambulance when some parameters are below certain thresholds, guaranteeing a reaction time of less than 5 seconds from the time the parameters get lower than the threshold.
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Product Functions}
		
		\subsection{User Characteristics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{Visitor}: a person visiting TrackMe without being registered. He can only proceed to registration in oder to actually use system services, otherwise he can't have access to any service or data.
				\item \texttt{System Administrator}: doesn't require to register himself. Makes sure there are no issues in the interaction between users and third parties, guaranteeing a certain level of security.
				\item \texttt{Registered user}: called simply \texttt{user} in this document. A person who registered himself to TrackMe, sharing his personal data. He can login to the system through provided credentials to exploit full services.
				\item \texttt{Third party user}: called simply \texttt{third party} in this document. A company or invidual using the platform for some statistical goal or to offer assistance to registered users.
				\item \texttt{Ambulance Dispatcher}: called simply \texttt{dispatcher} in this document. An external individual to the system, whose role is to dispatch an ambulance to assist specific users.
				\item \texttt{Monitoring System (???)}: monitors automatically users' health parameters.
				\item \texttt{Payment Management System (???)}: manages payment transactions, guaranteeing high level of security and reliability.
			\end{itemize}

	\section{Specific Requirements}
	\subsection{External Interface Requirments}
	\subsubsection{User Interface}
	The following mockups represt a basic idea of how the mobile application is supposed to look like.\\

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Images/registration}
		%\caption[Registration Form]{}
		\label{fig:registration}
	\end{figure}
	\subsection{Functional Requirments}
	\subsection{Non-functional Requirments}
	\subsubsection{Perfomance}
	The system must be able to handle a huge quantity of requests simultaneously throughout the day, responding to users' necessities in the shortest time possible. In order to improve the perfomance of the system, since data are received in a discrete way (e.g. monitored every 5 seconds), TrackMe relies on a UDP non-persistent connection.
	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	The system must guarantee a 24/7 service. This requirment should not have any sort of deviation (especially concerning AutomatedSOS).
	\subsubsection{Availability}
	The system must fullfil all the requests whenever needed (e.g. get/update personal information, request for medical assistance). Only a small percentage of the total requests is admissible (less than 0.01\% of the total amount of requests). The system relies on a RAPS architecture, to better guarantee availability. The whole system is partitioned in nodes, each one managing a single service, in which data is made redudant in different servers. In this way, the malfuction of a service will not cause a service breakdown, but only a decrease of performance.
	\subsubsection{Security}
	Despite the fact that personal information is stored, the system guarantees not to spread them outside, and third parties are obliged to be confirmed with a privacy policy.
	\subsubsection{Maintainability}
	Enforced by the usage of specific design patterns (e.g. third party subscription is notified through an Observer Pattern whenever new data is generated by the users) and the provided documentation.
	\subsubsection{Scalability}
	Relying on a RAPS architecture, it is easier to enlarge the structure of the system, since it is possible to invest only on those services that need to handle the higher amount of requests or the ones where the number of users is relevant.
